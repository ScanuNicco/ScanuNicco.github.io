# Scanu Productions Beta
This is the place where you can find the code that I am currently working on. Code here may have bugs or mignt not work yet at all.

<h2>Rag OS</h2>
Currently the oldest project here, <a href="https://scanunicco.github.io/Desktop">Rag OS</a>, Rag OS is a mock operating system coded in html. It can be compared to <a href="https://zorbulator.github.io/os/"> Zorb OS</a>. 
<br>
<h2>Rag Browser</h2>
<p><a href="ragbrowser.html">Rag Browser</a> is a simple yet fast browser. It's best feature is tecnophobe mode, which is great for tecnophobes and apple suckers who like having very few features and is a funny joke for everyone else.</p>
