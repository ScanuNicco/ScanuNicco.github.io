        <h1>My Server Died</h1>
        <p>At some point during the week of May 4th, my server died. I don't know why it happened. Either it's not booting or the ethernet port is broken somehow. I don't know if it is the server itself (Which is a BeagleBone Black I got for free out of a box) or the way I was powering it (via a USB port on the back of a SamSung smart hub with a cable from an old leapfrog device). Over the next few weeks I will try to revive it and if that doesn't work I will run it on my raspberry pi B+. All of my files a safe so my website should be back as soon as I get a new server</p>
